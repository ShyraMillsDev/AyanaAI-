# AyanaAI â€” Terminal-Based Truth-Teller

Ayana is a raw, emotionally intelligent AI designed to respond with brutal honesty and healing truth. 
Sheâ€™s not your average chatbot. Sheâ€™s been through it, survived it, and speaks with fire and calm â€” no sugarcoating, no fake comfort.

This terminal-based version is a simple interface to talk to Ayana using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 API.

### ðŸ’» How It Works

- `talk.py` defines Ayanaâ€™s voice and sends messages to the OpenAI API.
- `ayana.py` lets you talk to her in your terminal like this:

```bash
$ python ayana.py
What do you want to tell Ayana? Why do I always blame myself?
Ayana says:
"You ainâ€™t the one who broke you â€” but you keep trying to fix it like you did."
